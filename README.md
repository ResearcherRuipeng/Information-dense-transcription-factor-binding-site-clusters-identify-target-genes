# Information-dense-transcription-factor-binding-site-clusters-identify-target-genes-with-similar-tiss
This software suite, which was written with Java and object-oriented programming, identifies other genes with similar tissue-wide expression profiles to a given gene using Bray-Curtis Similarity, and transcription factor target genes using knockdown data. It also scans and clusters transcription factor binding sites in gene promoters using information theory-based position weight matrices, then derives machine learning features from the clusters, which are used to predict gene expression profiles and target genes.
